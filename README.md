# Synara · 可选语言社区版

基于上游 Synara **v0.8.3** 的 Windows x64 社区构建，新增可自行选择的界面语言：**跟随系统 / English / 简体中文**。入口为 **设置 → 常规 → Language / 语言**，切换立即生效并保存选择。

**[下载可选语言版](https://github.com/panda4556/synara/releases/latest)** · **[中文安装说明](./README.zh-CN.md)** · **[更新日志](./CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)** · **[本地化实现说明](./LOCALIZATION.zh-CN.md)**

当前社区版本：`v0.8.3-cn.1`。这是非官方、未签名的构建；只提供 Windows x64 安装包，不启用自动更新，不改变账号登录、模型或计费。聊天正文、代码与终端输出不作翻译，部分未覆盖的界面文案仍可能显示英文。

This community fork adds a persistent **System default / English / Simplified Chinese** selector to Synara v0.8.3. It is an unofficial, unsigned Windows x64 build. See the [community release](https://github.com/panda4556/synara/releases/latest) for downloads, checksums, upgrade instructions, and limitations. The original upstream README is retained below; its download links lead to the official builds, not this language-enabled build.

| Workspace layer      | Responsibility                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project**          | Repository context, settings, and related work.               |
| **Thread**           | Task-specific conversation, state, files, and history.        |
| **Provider session** | The authenticated coding-agent runtime executing the task.    |
| **Workspace tools**  | Changes, terminal, browser, files, editor, previews, and Git. |

> [!NOTE]
> Synara is early-stage software. APIs and interface details remain under active development.

## Capabilities

### 1. Projects, threads, and context

Organize work around projects and threads. Projects define the workspace; threads preserve the task-specific conversation, state, files, and history.

- Project-aware navigation and conversations
- Provider and model selection per task
- Thread history, status, recaps, notes, and side chats
- Search and quick access across active work

### 2. Integrated workspace tools

The tools surrounding an agent session remain available from the same task surface, keeping execution and review connected.

| Surface            | Purpose                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Changes**        | Inspect diffs, changed files, and review state.                                                   |
| **Terminal**       | Run commands in the project environment.                                                          |
| **Browser**        | Keep local previews next to the thread and let agents use semantic or page-declared WebMCP tools. |
| **Files / Editor** | Browse, inspect, and edit project files in context.                                               |
| **Git**            | Work with branches, commits, pushes, and pull requests.                                           |

### 3. Split views and previews

Keep an active conversation alongside the surface it is changing. Split views, browser previews, and device previews make the result part of the working context.

### 4. Provider-native integrations

Synara connects to coding-agent runtimes that are installed and authenticated locally. The current development build includes the following integrations:

| Runtime         | Local integration                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Codex**       | Codex CLI / app-server                      |
| **Claude**      | Claude Code                                 |
| **Cursor**      | Cursor agent runtime                        |
| **Antigravity** | Antigravity CLI                             |
| **Grok**        | Grok Build                                  |
| **Droid**       | Factory Droid                               |
| **OpenCode**    | OpenCode and its configured model providers |
| **Pi**          | Pi and its configured model providers       |
| **Devin**       | Devin CLI                                   |

### 5. Isolated parallel work

Managed worktrees provide a boundary for parallel changes. Handoffs preserve project context when a task needs to continue with another provider or toolchain.

- Run work in a local checkout or an isolated managed worktree
- Keep parallel threads from modifying the same checkout unintentionally
- Hand off a task without losing its project context
- Review the resulting diff before it leaves the workspace

### 6. Automations and external MCP

Automations support recurring agent runs and keep their outcomes attached to projects and threads. External MCP integrations provide scoped, user-approved access for other local clients.

See [External MCP integrations](./docs/external-mcp.md) for setup, pairing, project access, and permission boundaries.

### 7. Appearance and workspace preferences

Configure the shell to match the way you work with light and dark themes, typography controls, density preferences, and workspace settings.

| **Development**   | Desktop shell plus focused server and web modes.                |

## Installation

### Desktop application

Download the latest build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Emanuele-web04/synara/releases) or visit [trysynara.com](https://www.trysynara.com/).

Current native release targets are Windows x64, macOS Intel, macOS Apple Silicon, and Linux x64.

### Provider setup

Synara uses the provider installations and subscriptions already configured on the local machine. Install and authenticate the runtime you intend to use before starting a session. For Codex sessions, follow the [Codex CLI setup](https://github.com/openai/codex).

### Run from source

The development checkout uses [Bun 1.4.2](https://bun.sh/) and [Node.js 24.13.1](https://nodejs.org/).

```console
git clone https://github.com/Emanuele-web04/synara.git
cd synara
bun install
bun run dev
```

`bun run typecheck` checks all seven workspaces with TypeScript 7 and the native
Effect checker. CI and each workspace's `typecheck` script use the same compiler.
`bun run typecheck:native` remains an alias for the default check.

The native Effect checker does not enforce every legacy rule: in particular,
`importFromBarrel` errors are currently missed. `bun run typecheck:legacy` keeps
the TypeScript 5 check available for explicit comparisons; it is not run by CI.
The existing compiler also remains installed for build and declaration tools
that require its JavaScript API. Native and legacy checks use separate caches.

Use these named scripts rather than a bare `tsc`, whose version depends on the
current directory. Normal installation patches the native compiler for Effect;
the root `typecheck` command also ensures that patch is applied before checking.
